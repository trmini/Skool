Download the PGP package to the system or insert the PGP CD-ROM into the
CD-ROM drive.</li>

<li>
If this is the first time you are installing the PGP Command Line product
on this system, navigate to the directory where the <tt>PGPcmdln_x.x.x_Solaris</tt>
file is located, and begin installing the package by issuing the following
command (where <tt>x.x.x</tt> is the release number):&nbsp;</li>

<table BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 >
<tr>
<td><tt>pkgadd -d PGPcmdln_x.x.x_Solaris</tt></td>
</tr>

you must remove it before you can install the new package. You can remove
the installed package by issuing the following command:&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 >

<td><tt>pkgrm PGP</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>Note:</b> If you install from a CD-ROM drive under Sun Solaris, you
may receive a warning that tells you that the file system does not conform
to ISO-9660 specifications. This is because the name of the file contains
more than eight characters. Ignore this warning; the install will proceed
without problems.
<li>
Review the license agreement information, then type Y to accept the licensing
terms.&nbsp;</li>

<p><br>The installer processes the package and system information, verifies
disks space requirements, and installs the PGP Command Line program files.&nbsp;
<p><b>Note:</b> The program files are installed to the default installation
path of <tt>/opt/PGP/</tt>.
<li>
When the installation is complete, you can verify that the product was
installed properly by entering the following command:&nbsp;</li>

<table BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 >
