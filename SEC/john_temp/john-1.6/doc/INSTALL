 Installing John the Ripper
============================

 Compiling the Sources
-----------------------

Compile the sources with:

	cd src
	make

You'll get a list of supported systems. Select one of them, and type:

	make SYSTEM

or, if your system is not listed, try:

	make generic

If everything goes well, this will create the John binary in run/john.

You can then copy the run directory anywhere you like: these are all the
files that John needs at runtime.

 Installing from a Binary Distribution
---------------------------------------

You might need to take run/{john.ini,*.chr,password.lst} from the source
distribution for things to work, unless these files are present already.

 Note on Moving Binaries between Systems
-----------------------------------------

On some architectures, a few hardware performance parameters are detected
at compile time -- in particular, this is done for SPARC and generic make
targets. If you then move the binary to a different system, you might not
get the best performance. It is better to re-compile John on each system,
where possible.
