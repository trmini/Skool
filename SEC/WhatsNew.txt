    by issuing the following command:

    pkgadd -d PGPcmdfw_x.x.x_Solaris 

    (where x.x.x is the release number)

    If a previous version of the Command Line is

    and installs the PGP Command Line program files. 

    Note: The program files are installed to the 
    default installation path of /opt/PGP/. 

4.  When the installation is complete, you can 
    verify that the product was installed properly 
    by entering the following command:

    pkginfo -l PGP

    directory to your keyring.
