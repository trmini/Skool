I'd like to thank the following people for their direct or indirect help
in making John what it is now:

* Matthew Kwan --
	for letting me use his DES S-box file (nonstd.c):
	http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~mkwan/bitslice/;

* Eli Biham --
	for great "bitslice" paper:
	http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/cs0891.ps.gz;

* Roman Rusakov --
	for his optimization hints, and original x86 assembly DES code;

* Lionel Cons --
	for making me add the AFS passwords support, reporting some bugs,
	and for many good advices;

* stran9er --
	for tracking down the section alignment problem with MMX in the
	DOS and Win32 ports;

* All the people who have developed freeware crypt(3) implementations --
	for various tricks that I combined in my routines;

* Niels Provos and Poul-Henning Kamp --
	for original Blowfish-based and MD5-based crypt(3), respectively,
	that my implementations are compatible with;

* Alec Muffett --
	for the original wordlist rules syntax;

* The SOrCErEr --
	for proving the large charsets are worth implementing, and for
	introducing '-groups' in his cracker;

* Jackal --
	for the format of john.pot, and parts of the user interface;

* Anton Ertl --
	for "Labels as Values" optimization that I use in compiler.c:
	http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/papers/ertl96diss.ps.gz;

* The people at Cygnus --
	for Cygnus Developer's Kit (http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/)
	that I used for the Win32 port, and for EGCS;

* DJ Delorie --
	for DJGPP (http://www.delorie.com), and

* Charles W Sandmann --
	(sandmann@clio.rice.edu; 1206 Braelinn, Sugar Land, TX 77479),
	who wrote the DPMI server that I use for the DOS port: its source
	code is available at:
	ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2misc/csdpmi4s.zip.

 How Can I Contact You?
========================

Send mail to solar@false.com.

Please, don't ask me questions until you read doc/FAQ (and some FAQs on
password cracking in general, if you're unfamiliar with it). Also, do not
send me password files, I'm not a cracking service.

Signed,
Solar Designer
