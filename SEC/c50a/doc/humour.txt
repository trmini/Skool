Perhaps the strangest thing that has happened to me since first
writing Crack was being phoned up by an administrator at a really very
large chip-making company who just wanted to doublecheck that I hadn't
been hacking into his system.

Apparently some manager had received a nastygram telling him that he
had a weak password, and was demanding to know who this "Alec Muffett"
was and "Why he was breaking into our systems?!?"  I believe that he
had the poor guy phoning around various welsh universities trying to
find me, until he finally tracked me down.

I have no idea who was acually running Crack.
