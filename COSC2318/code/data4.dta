REDUCE A RATIONAL NUMBER
========================

  Divise both numerator and denominator by the GCF of the two numbers.

  24   3x8   3
  -- = --- = -
  32   4x8   4

NOTE: GCF stands for the Greatest Common Factors found in two or more
      numbers.
      For example:
      Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
      Factors of 32: 1, 2,    4,    8, 16, 32
      Common factors: 1, 2, 4, 8
      GCF is 8.
