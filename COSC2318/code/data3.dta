MIXED NUMBERS
=============

   When the numerator is less then the denominator, the fraction is
called a proper fraction, otherwise it is called an improper fraction.
   An improper fraction can be written as a mixed number, which has a
whole number and a fraction part.

  13    1                                 1
  -- = 3- (3 is the whole number part and - is fraction part)
   4    4                                 4
