Concerning GUIs.

Think about it this way:

		  Would you *really* like to see the
		 output from a Crack run at your site
		     to be available on the WWW?

also:

		    Would you *really* like people
			(other than yourself)
		to be able to control your Crack jobs?


No on both counts?

Jolly good - you've got more common sense than some other people I've
run into, then.

Seriously: given the networked nature of X-windows, whether you use
HTTP/cgi or a TCL/Tk GUI interface to browse Crack output, this is
pretty much what you're talking about; people you don't know being
able to read your Crack output, willy-nilly.

To be fair, though, this is also pretty much the case if you're
running "Crack -network", given the latter's preference for NFS as a
transport mechanism.  Using switched hubs on a LAN can help here, but
it ain't perfect.

On this basis I may get round to writing some sort of Crack "control
panel" in Perl/Tk or TCL/Tk for version 5.1, but don't hold your
breath waiting.  Crack is a "batch" program - not the easiest sort of
program to remote-control under Unix; perhaps I can put something
together to control it using named pipes, rather than suffering the
same goof that SATAN did and have weak authentication between server
and client - but then again named pipes aren't much use when running
Crack in networked mode.

In short: it's a real pig, and probably best ignored.

If you're just looking for a way to stop/start Crack at certain times
of day, check out "scripts/pauser".

If you're just looking for HTML output, try "Reporter -html".
