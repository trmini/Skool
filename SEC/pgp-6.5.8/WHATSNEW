INSTALLATION

To install PGP Command Line on a Windows machine: 

1.  Start the Windows system.

2.  Download the PGP files to the system or insert 
    the PGP CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

3.  Double-click SETUP.EXE to start the Setup program. 

    Note: If you are installing from the CD-ROM, the 
    Setup program automatically starts. If, however, 
    the Setup program does not initiate, double-click 
    SETUP.EXE in the Disk 1 folder on the CD-ROM.

    The PGP Command Line Welcome screen appears.

4.  Review the information in the Welcome screen, 
    then click Next.

    The Network Associates license agreement appears.

5.  Review the license agreement information, then 
    click Yes to accept the licensing terms.

6.  Use the default destination directory or click 
    Browse to navigate to a directory for your PGP 
    files, then click Next. 

    The PGP files are copied to the computer.

7.  Click Finish to complete the PGP Command Line 
    installation.

    The WhatsNew.txt file appears listing the new 
    features and other important information 
    regarding PGP Command Line. 


To install PGP Command Line on a Sun SparcStation:
(To install the software, you must have root privileges.)

1.  Download the PGP package to the system or insert 
    the PGP CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

2.  If this is the first time you are installing the 
    PGP Command Line product on this system, navigate 
    to the directory where the PGPcmdln_x.x.x_Solaris 
    file is located, and begin installing the package 
    by issuing the following command:

    pkgadd -d PGPcmdln_x.x.x_Solaris 

    (where x.x.x is the release number)

    If a previous version of the Command Line is 
    installed on this system, you must remove it 
    before you can install the new package.  You 
    can remove the installed package by issuing 
    the following command:

    pkgrm PGP

    Note: If you install from a CD-ROM drive under 
    Sun Solaris, you may receive a warning that 
    tells you that the file system does not conform 
    to ISO-9660 specifications. This is because 
    the name of the file contains more than eight 
    characters. Ignore this warning; the install 
    will proceed without problems.

3.  Review the license agreement information, then 
    type Y to accept the licensing terms.

    The installer processes the package and system 
    information, verifies disks space requirements, 
    and installs the PGP Command Line program files. 

    Note: The program files are installed to the 
    default installation path of /opt/PGP/. 

4.  When the installation is complete, you can 
    verify that the product was installed properly 
    by entering the following command:

    pkginfo -l PGP

    The status for the selected package should be 
    "STATUS: completely installed."


To install PGP Command Line on AIX and HPUX systems:

1.  Download the PGP package to the system or insert 
    the PGP CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

2.  Uncompress the package by issuing the following 
    command:

    gzip -d < PGPcmdln_x.x.x_AIX.tar.gz | tar xvf -

    or

    gzip -d < PGPcmdln_x.x.x_HPUX.tar.gz | tar xvf - 

    (where x.x.x is the release number)

   When the package is uncompressed, the pgp-6.5.8/ 
   directory is created.

3. To run the PGP Command Line application, enter the 
    following command:

    ./pgp


To install PGP Command Line on Linux RPM systems:
(To install the software, you must have root privileges.)

1.  Download the PGP files to the system or insert the 
    PGP CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

2.  Install the package by issuing the following 
    command:

    rpm -iv PGPcmdln_x.x.x_linux.i386.rpm

    (where x.x.x is the release number)

    The PGP program files are copied to the system.

3.  When installation is complete, verify the PGP 
    signature file by adding the PGP signature in the 
    SampleKeys.Asc file found in /usr/doc/pgp-x.x.x/ 
    directory to your keyring. 

    Once the PGP signature is added to your keyring, 
    issue the following command:

    rpm --checksig PGPcmdln_x.x.x_linux.i386.rpm

    (where x.x.x is the release number)

    If the signature is correct, the response from 
    this command is "OK." 

____________
KNOWN ISSUES

1. The BATCHMODE flag is not supported when used 
   with a UNIX-style filter.

2. The -m and -w options cannot be used together 
   (pgp -mw <file>). Use pgp -m first.

3. The functionality to preserve a signature from 
   within an encrypted file is not available in
   this release.

4. The ability to use the +makerandom feature is 
   not supported in this release.
